Node.js allows you to create fast and scalable applications, but as the load increases, performance issues can easily arise. To keep the server stable and fast, it is important to follow several best practices.
<h2>Asynchronous and Non-blocking Code</h2>
The main strength of Node.js is its asynchronous model. Avoid long synchronous operations and use async/await or callbacks. If you need to handle heavy tasks, offload them to a separate worker or queue.
<h2>Caching</h2>
Use caching for frequently requested data. This can be Redis, Memcached, or in-memory caching. This reduces the number of database calls and speeds up responses.
<h2>Load Balancing</h2>
For multi-core servers, enable the cluster module or use pm2. This allows you to run multiple Node.js processes and distribute the load among them.
<h2>Working with Databases</h2>
Optimize queries, use indexes, and limit the amount of data retrieved. For heavy operations, use queues and background tasks to avoid blocking the main thread.
<h2>Minimizing the Number of Requests</h2>
Reduce the number of server requests. Combine requests, use response compression (gzip, brotli), and use a CDN for static files.
<h2>Monitoring and Profiling</h2>
Integrate monitoring tools like pm2, New Relic, or Grafana with Prometheus. They help identify bottlenecks and overloads in time.
<h2>Using Streams</h2>
For working with large files, use streams (stream API). This allows processing data in chunks and saves memory.
<h2>Dependency Optimization</h2>
Do not include unnecessary libraries in your project. Each dependency increases startup time and memory usage. Periodically check the project using npm audit and depcheck.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Optimizing a Node.js application is a comprehensive task. Asynchronous code, caching, load balancing, monitoring, and proper database handling will help withstand high loads and ensure server stability.
